# Self-Assisted Priors Towards Robust Correction of Rigid Motion Artifact in Brain MRI

This project is developed to correct the motion artifacts in brain MRI. 

We propose an efficient retrospective method called self-assisted priors with cascaded refinement network for Reduction of Rigid Motion Artifacts in Brain MRI.
